This project is aiming to study 32 whole genome samples of infected SIAV pigs (16 pigs) for viral evolution. 



It will include a copy of the papers data, a fastQC run of each of the samples, as well as trimming and alignments to a reference genome. The repository will be following the same guidelines as the paper in attempts to recreate the data.
